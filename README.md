# Protostar-Exploit-Development-Exercise
My notes for Linux x86 exploit development of the exercises in protostar from exploit education

Protostar is a virtual machine from Exploit Exercises (now known as Exploit Education) that goes through basic memory corruption issues and is the perfect place to learn linux x86 exploit development.

Protostar introduces the following in a friendly way:

Network programming
Byte order
Handling sockets
Stack overflows
Format strings
Heap overflows
The above is introduced in a simple way, starting with simple memory corruption and modification, function redirection, and finally executing custom shellcode.

In order to make this as easy as possible to introduce, Address Space Layout Randomisation and Non-Executable memory has been disabled.

You can download the protostar virutal machine from here:
